# python-api-Challenge

This challenge was created to test out abilities to utalize api's and json

We were told to utalize the weather api on over 500 cities to find these criteria.
City,	Lat, Lng, Max Temp, Humidity,	Cloudiness,	Wind Speed,	Country and Date

Then we needed to create scatter plots for these data sets 
  Latitude vs. Temperature

  Latitude vs. Humidity

  Latitude vs. Cloudiness

  Latitude vs. Wind Speed

After these scatter plots were created we then had to create new scatter plots and find the corrilation between the two factors and analyses in which plots
there was a corrilation and how strong the corrilation was. Theses scatter plots followed these two factors

  Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

  Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

  Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

  Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

  Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

  Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

  Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

  Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude


Once this was completed we needed to use geoapify on a list of cities

We ploted the cities on a world map and altered the size of their location markers to be in proportion to their humidity levels

We then took the list of cities and altered it to search for more ideal weather conditions

Lastly, using this new dataframe we had to find a hotel within 10,000 meters of the city centre using geoapify

In regards to the WeatherPy file
I attempted to use the break function to test out my code and not waste the use of my 1000 free api calls
However, i placed it in the wrong area and created a error message at the end of the output. Since the output used over 500 of my api uses, i could not re run the cell. So despite the error message at the bottom i removed the misplaced break and all the information is correct regarding the outputed URLs
