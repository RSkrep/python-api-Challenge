# python-api-Challenge

This challenge was created to test our abilities to utilize api's and json

We were told to utilize the weather api on over 500 cities to find these criteria.
City, Latitude, Longitude, Max Temp, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed, Country and Date

Then we needed to create scatter plots for these data sets 
  Latitude vs. Temperature

  Latitude vs. Humidity

  Latitude vs. Cloudiness

  Latitude vs. Wind Speed

After these scatter plots were created we then had to create new scatter plots and find the correlation between the two factors and analyses in which plots
there was a correlation and how strong the correlation was. Theses scatter plots followed these two factors

  Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

  Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

  Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

  Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

  Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

  Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

  Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

  Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude


Once this was completed we needed to use geoapify on a list of cities

We plotted the cities on a world map and altered the size of their location markers to be in proportion to their humidity levels

We then took the list of cities and altered it to search for more ideal weather conditions

Lastly, using this new data frame we had to find a hotel within 10,000 meters of the city center using geoapify

In regards to the WeatherPy file
I attempted to use the break function to test out my code and not waste the use of my 1000 free api calls
However, I placed it in the wrong area and created a error message at the end of the output. Since the output used over 500 of my api uses, I could not re run the cell. So despite the error message at the bottom I removed the misplaced break and all the information is correct regarding the outputted URLs

Completion process I would first attempt to find each of these values using my memory, then I would look into the class notes and activities as a way to find out my next course of action when I was lost. After doing these steps I would consult ChatGPT to find out where I went wrong and would use its assistance to correct the code as well as explain its process to me so I could understand for the future how to fulfill these tasks without aid.
